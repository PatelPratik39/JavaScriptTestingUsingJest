        4. Run command : "npm test" ---> this command will run the test.
        5. Jest has a watch mode that lets you automatically re-run tests when you make changes to your code.
            To use watch mode, run Jest with the --watch or -w option: "jest --watch" or "jest -w"
        6. The â€“watchAll option in jest enables you to monitor and react to changes in all files,
            regardless of whether they have been modified since the last commit.
